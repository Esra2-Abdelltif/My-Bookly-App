# My Bookly Project

The app offers users the ability to preview books, search for titles, and browse by category—making it easy for book lovers to find exactly what they’re looking for. From the seamless API integration to leveraging the BLoC state management, I implemented the MVVM pattern to ensure the app is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.
